/**
 * Variety of physically different connections between physical elements as well
 * as the definition of generic nodes between the connections. All connections
 * defined in this package inherit from the {@link CircuitConnection} prototype and
 * extend it by defining the type of connection (thermal, electric, fluid). Nodes
 * between the connections extend the base class {@link GenericCircuit} by defining
 * the type of circuit modeled by the resource. Topologically, a circuit is a 
 * point that can be the input or output of any number of connections. In practice,
 * the circuit can be a complete heating circuit or only a sub-set of it, depending
 * on the detail level that has been chosen to model connections and circuits.

/**
 * Actor devices, i.e. switches. All actors inherit from the {@link Actor} basis model. 
 * The models
 * defined in this package can be physical devices by themselves, but often are 
 * control switches that are part of another device. For actual devices, using the
 * models in {@link org.ogema.model.devices.sensoractordevices} is recommended.<br>
 * While {@link org.ogema.model.sensors.Sensor}s only
 * have a single {@link org.ogema.model.sensors.Sensor#reading()} entry, actors have two equivalent fields:
 * the {@link Actor#stateControl()} setting is used by the application to send their
 * required actor states. The {@link Actor#stateFeedback} holds the actual actor
 * setting as reported by the device (which may ignore the request for some reason).

/**
 * Defines a connection between two physical objects. The actual type of the
 * connection is defined by the model type inheriting from this prototype. In
 * case of sensor values relating to some kind of flow (energy transfer, actual
 * flow of a liquid, ...) positive values of the flow refer to the direction
 * "input" to "output". <br>
 * In cases where a device operates on a connection or constitutes a connection
 * in its own right (e.g. a heat pump) the a connection element is part of the
 * device's data model as a sub-resource (no inheritance). Input and output fields
 * of the connection may be empty, if their meaning is obvious (or unknown and 
 * irrelevant). For example, many residential electric devices will have an 
 * {@link ElectricityConnection} that only contains sensor readings but no 
 * information about the topology of the electric grid they are connected to. <br>
 * <br>
 * How to handle general topologies: A generic circuit consisting of an arbitrary number of 
 * nodes and connections between nodes (arbitrary number of connections per node, 
 * one or two nodes per connection) can be modeled by using {@link GenericCircuit} elements 
 * for both the input and output fields of the connection; a GenericCircuit 
 * element is best thought of as a circuit node then.

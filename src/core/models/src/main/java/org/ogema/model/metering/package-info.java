 * Metering devices and information. All meter models derive from the {@link GenericMeter},
 * which defines a common structure but no metering registers by itself (they depend on
 * the actual type of meter). All meters refer to metering a connection. If a physical
 * meter delivers real-time information about the measured quantities (e.g. power), the
 * meter driver is advised to put this information into the connection's respective
 * sensor readings in addition to the meter's register's resource.

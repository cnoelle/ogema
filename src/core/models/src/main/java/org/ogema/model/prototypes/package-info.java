/**
 * Most basic data models. Prototypes should not be used as actual resource types.
 * Instead, all non-prototype data models inherit from a prototypes (note that
 * this does not conflict with prototypes having non-prototype sub-resources). There
 * are three prototypes that are defined: <br>
 * {@link PhysicalElement} is the prototype
 * for anything that is, or could sensibly be, a physical object. Most notably this
 * includes devices and {@link org.ogema.model.sensors.Sensor}s.<br>
 * A {@link Connection}
 * connects two physical objects with a third physical object, usually a device
 * related to energy management, possibly operating on the connection. In the easiest
 * case they are just informal relations between objects, but connections with actual
 * relevant properties of themselves have also been defined. An example
 * is a {@link org.ogema.model.connections.ThermalConnection} between the outside of a building and a heating circuit, 
 * where a heat pump is the device that operates on this connection by actively
 * transporting heat through it.<br>
 * {@link Data} is a generic prototype for any type of information that is not, 
 * or cannot sensibly be, a physical object and is not a connection.

 * The API of the channel manager. The channel manager can optionally be used by a high-level driver for communication
 * with real devices. Numerous communication protocols have been implemented by so called low-level drivers. Installed
 * low-level drivers are automatically detected by the channel manager. The channel manager offers a single convenient
 * API to the high-level drivers. The main interface of the channel manager is {@link ChannelAccess}. Among other things
 * it can be used to configure and access channels or set update listeners that are notified of new incoming values.

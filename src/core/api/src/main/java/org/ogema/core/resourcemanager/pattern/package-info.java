/**
 * Definitions of the pattern access to resources. An application can define a
 * pattern in the resource graph by defining a class that inherits from
 * {@link org.ogema.core.resourcemanager.pattern.ResourcePattern}. The generic
 * parameter of the pattern defines the resource type of the root node. Resource
 * fields in the defining class can the be used to define the pattern. The
 * annotations in {@link org.ogema.core.resourcemanager.pattern.ResourcePattern}
 * can be added to these fields to define the required
 * {@link org.ogema.core.resourcemanager.AccessMode} (for searching commands,
 * only) as well as optional fields in the pattern. The
 * {@link org.ogema.core.resourcemanager.pattern.ResourcePatternAccess} allows
 * to create such patterns and to register
 * {@link org.ogema.core.resourcemanager.pattern.PatternListener}s that keep the
 * application updated on all matches for the pattern that exist in the resource
 * graph.

/**
 * Definition of {@link org.ogema.core.model.simple.FloatResource}
 * specializations that represent a physical property. All the specializations
 * implement the interface
 * {@link org.ogema.core.model.units.PhysicalUnitResource} in addition to the
 * FloatResource. A specialization exists for every commonly-used property,
 * which also defines the unit the property is measured. The currently-supported
 * units are defined in {@link org.ogema.core.model.units.PhysicalUnit}. <br>
 *
 * OGEMA tries to provide a useful list of properties, but can never be complete
 * in this respect. If no suitable physical property is available, plain
 * {@link org.ogema.core.model.simple.FloatResource}s can be used. The unit used
 * must then be explicitly defined in the definition of the data model.

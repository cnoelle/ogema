/**
 * Defininition of schedules, which are
 * {@link org.ogema.core.timeseries.TimeSeries TimeSeries}-valued resources.
 * Schedules are always sub-resources of a resource that holds a non-array
 * value; their entries are of the same type as that parent resources' ones.
 * OGEMA knows two types of schedules,
 * {@link org.ogema.core.model.schedule.DefinitionSchedule}s and
 * {@link org.ogema.core.model.schedule.ForecastSchedule}s. Both types are
 * technically identical. They differ in their interpretation. Forecasts are
 * guesses about the future, which may or may not come true. Definition
 * schedules are used for values that either had been true in the past (which
 * never changes) or, in case of future definition schedules, decribe a program
 * for the respective parent resource.

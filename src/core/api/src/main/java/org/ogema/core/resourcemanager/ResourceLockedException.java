/*
 * - The Lock status for the resources can not be maintained persistent but only at runtime.

/*
 * - Delete a resource is not allowed if the resource itself, or at least one of its SubResource is marked as locked.
 */
/*
 * - Locked resources can be read but not written. So, the RsourceLockedException be thrown by the setter methods. But
 * this is controlled by the ResourceAdministration, so that the ResourceDB doesn't need to check the locked status
 * before setting a resource value. But in case of deleting of ResourceTypes ResourceDB has to check if resources exist
 * from the type to be deleted. In this case ResourceLockedException is to be thrown.

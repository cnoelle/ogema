 * via {@link #setMaximumLogLevel(LogOutput, LogLevel)}, but the configuration of the outputs themselves is restricted
 * to OGEMA administrators using the {@link org.ogema.core.administration.AdminLogger} interface. Additionally, an
 * application can ask for the current {@link LogOutput#CACHE} to be written to a file, which can be used for in-depth
 * analysis of an error that occurred.
 * 
 * In the absence of administrator settings, OGEMA frameworks must provide sensible default settings for the

/**
 * Definition of the simple resources that contain only a single entry (in
 * contrast to their array-counterparts and schedules). For most Java
 * primitives, a corresponding resource holding a value of this type is defined
 * with a suitable name. For example, a
 * {@link org.ogema.core.model.simple.FloatResource} holds a float (note that
 * the {@link org.ogema.core.model.units.PhysicalUnitResource}s extend the float
 * resource for cases where the value represents a physical property). Two
 * notable exceptions exist:<br>
 * - the {@link org.ogema.core.model.simple.TimeResource} holds a long value. In
 * OGEMA, times shall always be given as ms since 1970 (UTC).

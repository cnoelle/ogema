/**
 * Provides the interfaces to manage the policies of access control in OGEMA framework.
 * The protection of security sensitive resources is performed by setting of policies
 * that are referenced to an application or an user. An AppPermission instance is linked
 * with a such entity and contains a number of AppPermissionTypes. Each AppPermissionType
 * instance describes a policy that is valid for the owner entity. The sum of all policies
 * described in AppPermissionType objects is the collection of the effective granted
 * permissions to this entity.
 * 
 * The PermissionManager supports application in reading or writing of the policies
 * for an application. The access rights for an user can be manipulated via AccessManager.
 * WebAccessManager holds the registration of web resources by the application and
 * controls the rights to access to these resources.

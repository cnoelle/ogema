/**
 * Definition of the OGEMA text logging capabilities, which are employed using an
 * {@link OgemaLogger}. The logging is defined as an extension over the well-known
 * logging framework slf4j. It defines an additional {@link LogOutput}, the
 * cache. It is a cyclic memory constructed for debug messages that only become
 * relevant in case of an error. If an error occurs, the cache can be written to
 * disk for further analysis. Otherwise, entries in the cache will be overwritten
 * by newer entries, later.

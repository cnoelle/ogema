/**
 * Definition a key element of the OGEMA framework, the {@link Resource} interface.
 * Also defines the special resource type {@link ResourceList}, which tries to
 * mimic the resource equivalent of a Java List (with reduced functionality) and
 * the marker interface {@link SimpleResource} which identifies resources that
 * can contain a value or an array of values (note that schedules are not simple
 * resources). The {@link ModelModifiers} are framework-defined annotations that
 * are used in the modeling of new resource types. <br>
 * The sub-packages define the core resource types defined in OGEMA. The non-simple
 * models describing devices, relations, communication data, ... are not defined
 * in the OGEMA API but are contained in the separate package with the OGEMA Data Model.<br>

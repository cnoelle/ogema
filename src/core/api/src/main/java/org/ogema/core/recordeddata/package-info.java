 * by setting a suitable

 * read out, the logdata are returned in the form of a special
 * {@link org.ogema.core.timeseries.ReadOnlyTimeSeries}, an instance of
 * {@link org.ogema.core.recordeddata.RecordedData}. This object allows direct
 * access to the individual log entries as well as access through a
 * {@link org.ogema.core.recordeddata.ReductionMode} filter.

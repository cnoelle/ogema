/**
 * Definition of {@link org.ogema.core.timeseries.TimeSeries}, which are
 * functions over time. Time series are modeled as a set of support points of
 * type {@link org.ogema.core.channelmanager.measurements.SampledValue} (the
 * entries) together with an {@link org.ogema.core.timeseries.InterpolationMode}
 * that defines the values of the function between the support points. Limited
 * definition ranges of the time series, including gaps in the definition range,
 * can be modeled using a bad
 * {@link org.ogema.core.channelmanager.measurements.Quality}. If the quality of
 * a time series is bad, the time series should be considered as not being
 * (sensibly) defined for this time.

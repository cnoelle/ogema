 * The HardwareManager is responsible to manage a list of currently available hardware.
 * Additional Information is available in HardwareDescriptors that can be accessed via

 * The Hardware interface supports channel management and the entire framework,
 * including the applications. Mainly binding of devices to the Ogema gateway is done via USB ports.
 * But there are other devices which could be connected via digital IOs or native UARTs.

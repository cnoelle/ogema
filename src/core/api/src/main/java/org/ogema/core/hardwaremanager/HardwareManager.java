/**
 * This class provides information about hardware connected to the system. The hardware management is informative,
 * actual claiming and opening of hardware is done in the respective APIs (i.e. rxtx).
 * 
 * Devices are connected to the to the Ogema gateway mainly via USB. But there are other devices which could be
 * connected via digital IO or native UARTs.
 * 
 * A connected device is unambiguously identified in the system with an identifier string. The format of the identifier
 * string varies according to the connection type (USB, Serial, digitalIO). The first part of an identifier string is
 * the type of the connection (e.g. usb, serial, io).
 * 
 * --- USB --- An USB identifier string consists of the vendor and product id of the device, the (optional) serial
 * number of the device, the configuration and interface and the physical path to the device (root hub port on hub port
 * on hub device). Example: a FTDI serial adapter connected to port 1 of an intermediate hub, connected to root hub 1
 * "usb:1.1:1.0:0x0403:0x06001:FTU74ZQE" "connection type: physical bus location: vendor id: product id: serial number"
 * 
 * --- Serial --- A serial identifier string simply list the number/name of the port: "serial:1" "connection type: port
 * number"
 * 
 * --- Digital IO --- A digitalIO identifier string has the format: "digitalIO:in:portID:pinID"
 * 
 * The identifier string is used when identifying hardware and requesting hardware access.
 * 
 * Additional Information is available in HardwareDescriptors that contain additional information according to the
 * connection type of the device. The most important information would be the port name (Windows) or device file (Linux)
 * of the device.
 * 
 * When the system boots, all devices are presented to the Framework. If a OGEMA bus system driver is installed, all
 * available device descriptions are presented so that a descriptor can be chosen. The administrator can associate the
 * OGEMA driver with a device. These associations are stored persistently and compared after each reboot with the
 * existing hardware configuration and updated if necessary.
 * 
 * If a device is removed or added new one, the table of devices is updated so that it constantly reflects the current
 * state of the hardware configuration.

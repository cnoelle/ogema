/**
 * Interface to get all from DB needed for the ResourceAdministration
 * 
 * A resource is initially created containing only the required (non-optional) sub resources. The optional elements are
 * not (yet) created when calling addResource, but have to be added, when resource is decorated. When this occurs, the
 * corresponding values of the optional elements can, however, be persistently stored. Conversely, it may be that values
 * are non-optional, but their values are not yet persisted (for example, in the model, the value TempSens mmxTemp is
 * mandatory (must always be read and written), but is not persistent). Say the database needs to know that there is the
 * element mmxTemp, but do not store the actual float. The methods isOptional and isPersistent are independent of each
 * other.<br>
 * Note: The Id values of the top level resources are persistent and do not change over the entire lifetime of a
 * resource. The indexes/ids of the sub resources may change on every startup of the framework, but remain valid until
 * shutdown of the application accessing the index.
 *

This folder contains configuration files for a simple remote logging configuration.
On the client, an additional logger appender is configured ("SOCKET"), whose log messages are
transferred to the server and added to the server logs. The corresponding server component
is a logback receiver.
Note that this basic example uses HTTP only; in a production setting TLS should be enabled.
For TLS and other settings, see

/**
 * Configuration for a threshold-manipulator involving a source resource s, a
 * target resource t and a threshold x. The value of T is kept up-to-date
 * according to whether s exceeds x or not. Two parameters allow further
 * modification of the rule: An equality flag E allows to count the equality
 * case s=x to be effectively treated as "value exceeds the threshold", and an
 * inversion flag I allows to invert the value set into the target resource.
 * Both flags are false by default. The effective rules enforced are as
 * follows:<br>
 * E = false : t = I XOR (s&gt;x) <br>
 * E = true : t = I XOR (s&gt;=x) <br>
 *
 * If s becomes inactive, t is set inactive, too.
